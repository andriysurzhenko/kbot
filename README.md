Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Andrii
A support engineer.
I'm currently working on acquiring skills to become a DevOps engineer.
This is my first attempt in creating a Telegram bot.

This application communicates via the telegram bot.
The application was created using GO.
The application has only educational purposes.
Only several simple commands are supported.

How to deploy it:
1. Create a Telegram via 'https://t.me/botfather'
2. Collect a token for your bot
3. Clone the repository
4. Set enviromental varibale 'TELE_TOKEN' for your bot
5. Build an application
6. Execute
